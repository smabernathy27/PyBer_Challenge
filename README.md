# PyBer_Challenge

## Overview of the analysis
The goal of our analysis here was to look at the differences and similarities between the ride data for the different city types. We looked at the driver counts, fares,  ride counts, average fares per ride and average fares per driver for each type of city to get a complete picture.

## Results
Looking through our data it is clear that Urban cities have the most rides and drivers which led to the most money made off of fares for PyBer. This makes sense with the increased population of Urban cities. However, the both the Suburban and Rural cities have a higher average fare per ride and a higher average fare per driver with Rural being the highest out of all 3. With less drivers and possibly greater distances to cover in Rural cities, it would make sense for each fare to be a little higher for each ride/driver.

## Summary
Based on these results, I would have a couple of suggestions for the CEO. First, I noted that the total drivers for Urban cities is greater than the total rides. It would make sense to filter down or remove some drivers so each driver can make more on average and get rides when they want. As of now, there would have to be drivers not getting any rides. Additionally, per the line chart, each city had their best week of the winter at the same time at the end of February. I would suggest to the CEO to make sure we have enough drivers working at that time again next year. Lastly, there is a huge discrepancy in total rides between the Urban cities and the Rural and Suburban cities which is to be expected. Either way, I would suggest possibly doing some more marketing in the Suburban/Rural areas to see if more rides can be purchased.
